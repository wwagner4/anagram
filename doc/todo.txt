- Plain mapping with common words. E.g. the most common words in the books.
-- Make Wordlist configurable

- Plain mapping using word frequency

- Grammar mapping using word frequency

- Adding new books




----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Solver uses SortedMap as Parameter. No return

-  Solver
--  Parallel processing with Akka

-    Word mapping
-- OK Map similar groups to similar numbers
--- OK E.g. sort by wordlength, alphabetically
---    Similarity could be learned with ml
----    Get a dataset describing the similarity of groups ???



----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- OK Refactoring remove SolverIter

- OK Solver should not return Ana but Iterable[String]

- OK Connect the mapper from learning with the one used in prediction
-- OK There could be two mappers WordMapper WordMapperPrediction.

- OK Use simple wordlist
-- OK Wordlist loadable
-- OK Wordlist saveable

- OK Create data
-- OK Use only sentances that contain groups from the simple wordlist
-- OK sould not return empty groups. ???
-- OK sould not return duplicate sentances. ???
--- OK make testcase 'wolfi' with wordlist
-- OK Optimize runtime with cache
